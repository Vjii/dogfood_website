This is my first, experimental website.

It has a ton of flaws and very poorly organized code because I created it before properly learning from courses/tutorials. The decision was to teach myself as much about HTML/CSS (additionally about googling & using docs) as possible by jumping right into action and to see what/how much I don't know, as oppossed to studying theory and tutorials first.

Contains HTML/CSS only. Fully RWD though.
